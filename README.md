# "The BioHackathon Cloud" issues @ BioHackEU24

This repository serves a single purpose:

**Use the [issue board](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/biohackeu24/issues) to
[create issues](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/biohackeu24/issues/new/choose)
and link them to our [centralized BioHackathon project
board](https://github.com/orgs/elixir-cloud-aai/projects/23)!**

**Notes:**

1. For **issues associated with existing [`elixir-cloud-aai`
   repositories](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai) repositories** (i.e., repos
   owned by _this_ organization), then it is generally recommended to create
   the issue directly in these repositories (as they can be directly associated with
   the project board).
2. If you want to **associate an existing issue in an external repo** with the project
   board, create an issue here, give it an expressive title, add appropriate labels,
   associate it with the project board and only add a reference to the original
   issue in the description; no need to repeat the actual description.
